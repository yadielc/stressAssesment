<strong> Stress Assessment: An Artifical Intelligence Expert System </strong><br>


This is the back-end to an expert system done in Java.
The purpose of the system is to determine the level of vulnerability of
a person and urgency of therapy to a potential patient. The system recommends
to the patient if he/she has to undertake mental therapy or not by the data obtained from the
Holmes and Rahe questionnaire answered by the patient.

Here's a diagram of the a sample decision tree performed by the system.
